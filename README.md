Questions:

How long are the time slots?
Does there need to be a buffer between?

Make it look good on mobile

Improvements:

Admin privledges to edit bookings

It's not repsonsive to view sizes smaller than ---
deal with react router issues with reload and history
there is some inconsistency in when I used a style sheet and inline styling with the materialUI components.
Add custom 404 Page
Filter by location and availability

Todo:
How does doctor get informed of a booking?
How does doctor set their available times?
Deal with a broken/missing link to doctor image
the book time button is expanding the height of the card
Add more typing
button to return to main page
add icon for tab
deal with am, pm times
deal with limitng time slots showing on page. Allow to look at later dates.
